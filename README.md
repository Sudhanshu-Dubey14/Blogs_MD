Hey, Welcome to the blog_MDs of my site [Hacksd](https://hacksd.wordpress.com/). All my blogs are written in Pandoc's version Markdown.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Markdown can be used for everything, it is portable and platform independent.

Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. Pandoc can convert between numerous markup and word processing formats, including, but not limited to, various flavors of Markdown, HTML, LaTeX and Word docx.

So, here are the MDs of my blog:
